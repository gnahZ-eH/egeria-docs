# Dojo Introduction

The Egeria "dojo" is an intensive course to help you learn about Egeria. It is designed as a 5-day effort, although, since it is self-study you can dip in and out of it as time permits.

The objectives of the five days are as follows:

- **Running Egeria** day: Learning about setting up and running Egeria.
- **Developer** day: Learning how to call Egeria's APIs and develop new connectors to integration third party technologies.
- **Metadata Governance** day: Learning how to improve the quality and expand the content of your metadata.
- **Egeria Contributor** day: Learning how to make a contribution to Egeria. Learning how to go on to become either an advocate or a maintainer.
- **Egeria in Production** day: Learning how to run Egeria in production with high availability and resilience.

The sessions are color-coded like ski runs:

!!! beginner "Beginner session"

!!! intermediate "Intermediate session"

!!! advanced "Advanced session"

!!! expert "Expert session"

As you progress through the dojo, the colors of the sessions show how advanced your knowledge is becoming.

The schedule also includes estimated times needed to complete each session. Do take breaks whenever needed!
